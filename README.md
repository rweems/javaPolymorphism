# Java Polymorphism

Decided to mess around with some polymorphism and inheritance in java late at night. 

Steps to run:
1. Download or copy source file(.java) to location on computer
2. In terminal locate the source file previously downloaded
3. Run __javac AnimalPolymorphism.java__
4. Run __java AnimalTestDrive__
